# About Me
Hi, I’m Talha, a first-semester Computer Science student at FAST University Karachi.  
I’ve already explored Python during A-Levels and am now diving into C, sharpening my fundamentals while aiming to become a top developer.

## Programming Interests
- Building practical projects with Python and C
- Exploring AI/ML and data-driven applications
- Automating everyday tasks to save time
- Web technologies I plan to learn next (JavaScript/React)

> I enjoy turning ideas into code that actually solves problems—always curious to learn the next skill that raises the bar.
